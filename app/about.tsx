  <p className="mb-4">
    I began coding in high school, creating small apps in my spare time. I did not think of it anything much back then and took it as a hobby.
     After highschool, I got into web development and have been building web apps ever since.
  </p>
  <p className="mb-4">
    Outside of work, Iâ€™m focused on personal projects and exploring my interests in blockchain and microservices. 
    When I'm not in front of a screen, you can usually find me on the basketball court or hiking in the nearby mountains.
